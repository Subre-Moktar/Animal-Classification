# Animal-Classification
We will be training a model for animal classfication for video object detection. We will be using youtube videos to detect animals off of that video, with a front end development, so that the user just needs to paste the video link inside. A collaborative Project

We will be using the YOLOv7 model, with using youtube videos as the input, or personal videos

Steps:
Install python3.11
Install Virtual Environment
Install Dependinces from requirements.txt file
Git Clone yolov7 - https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7 
There are other ways to get the model if needed
Test - (See if they can run the model off laptops using camera)
Collecting The images off of Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals.
Train and test the Model off of these images.
Use Pytube to have the model run on youtube videos / mp4 videos also
Create an interface so that people could interact with the model
  If possible also include time stamps of when the animal comes into view and when it leaves on the video.
upload the model
